## Replace Disqus
Most templates and blogs nowadays use Disqus for the comment sections. But I don't like it that all my readers comments are captured by a commercial server that tries to make all their comments on various sites into targeted advertising. There is a good [explanation of that on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus). 

I also don't like the fact that my content is at the mercy of a server far a way that just gives me an iframe with a view on their server.

So I went looking for alternatives.
