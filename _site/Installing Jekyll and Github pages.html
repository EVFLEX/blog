<p><strong>I wanted to create my website using Github pages and Jeckyll. Here’s how I did it.</strong></p>

<p><a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyllrb</a> is supposed to be the comprehensive reference for this but because I wanted something quick that took my by the hand I followed along with this <a href="https://youtu.be/nN6QuNqmAwk">video by Brad Westfall</a>.</p>

<h3 id="make-powershell-default">Make powershell default</h3>
<p>First I made powershell the default command line on my windows machine. Simply install powershell and run the <a href="http://blogs.interfacett.com/how-make-powershell-default-console-windows-server-core">first script on this page</a>. Powershell can do much more than your regular command line. Two examples: it supports cut-and-paste and shows you which branch you are in.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-hello-world-page">Create a hello world page</h3>
<p>I opened github for windows and (using the gearwheel) opened the github shell. Powershell opened for me in the right directory (github root). Then I typed:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir evflex        # to create a directory
cd blog             # go into the directory
git init            # to create the repo (.git files) here
touch index.html    # to create the index file that github will look for
</code></pre>

<p>For testing an empty index.html file is not optimal. So I opened it in an editor (like atom or notepad) and typed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
   &lt;HEAD&gt;
      &lt;TITLE&gt;
         evflex says hello
      &lt;/TITLE&gt;
   &lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
   &lt;H1&gt;evflex are go&lt;/H1&gt;
   &lt;P&gt;Hello evflex readers!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I saved my changes, closed the editor and switched back to powershell. I added the file and made my initial commit:</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "init"
</code></pre>

<p>Then I went to github.com to create the remote repo on github. I chose create new repo, typed in evflex, unchecked “make readme.md” and on the next page there was a command for when you already have a local repo. This I pasted into my local powershell with rightclick:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:AukeHoekstra/evflex.git
git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the local repo where to find its remote repo on github and it pushes the first content (the index.html file) to the remote repo.</p>

<p>Finally I created a branch called gh-pages. This special branch is where the Jekyll server on github.com will be looking for new content. From this branche I pushed the index.html page to github:</p>

<pre><code>git branch gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>That is basically it. After a few minutes (it can take hours) I surfed to the following location to admire my message to the world:</p>

<pre><code>aukehoekstra.github.io/evflex.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="connect-evflexgithubio-to-evflexorg">Connect evflex.github.io to evflex.org</h3>
<p>Buy .org and .com, .net, .nl and .eu.
Redirect .org to github.
Redirect .com, .net, .nl and .eu to .org.</p>

<p>The video says to create a file called “CNAME” with as content just the URL where you want to point from. E.g. evflex.org. Then:</p>

<pre><code>git add . 
git commit -m "cname"
git checkout gh-pages # switches you to the gh-pages branch
git merge master # merges cname file of the master into gh-pages
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
git push # puts the content of gh-pages on github
</code></pre>

<p>The first time I failed because the video did not prompt me to set the upstream branch. But this worked so to check I went to github.com, refreshed the page and saw that CNAME showed up in the branch.</p>

<p>Another problem I ran into was that github kept warning me that it had added Github (RSA) to the list of known hosts. Jeremiah Gowdy came up with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9299651/warning-permanently-added-to-the-list-of-known-hosts-message-from-git">the solution on stackoverflow</a>: go to users\Auke.ssh and add a file called config with the line “UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts”. Problem solved.</p>

<p>The final step is to tell the registrar to point to Github. In my case this is Byte.nl. So I surfed to their service panels DNS settings and create the following records:</p>

<pre><code>evflex.org, type A, content 192.30.252.153
evflex.org, type A, content 192.30.252.154
www.evflex.org, type CNAME, content evflex.org
</code></pre>

<p>This can take up to 24 hours but within a minute I could type <evflex.org> and <www.evflex.org> and I was taken directly to my Hello world page at aukehoekstra.github.io/evflex without me (or my reader) noticing.</www.evflex.org></evflex.org></p>

<h3 id="install-jekyll">Install Jekyll</h3>
<p>Windows is not officially supported (?) but I was directed to <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/</a>. This site told me to to to <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a> and install Ruby and the Devkit (like DevKit-mingw64). I had to restart the computer before I could give the following commands in powershell:</p>

<pre><code>cd c:\Ruby22-x64start
ruby dk.rb init 
ruby dk.rb install
</code></pre>

<p>Then I installed Python version 2 (!). Don’t forget to choose “add python.exe to path” as a complete install on the harddrive. This will also give you pip. Finally we do:</p>

<pre><code>gem install jekyll # takes a while
cd c:\users\auke\github
jekyll new blog # lots of files into the blog
cd blog
jekyll serve
</code></pre>

<p>Surf to the ip number that Jekyll shows in powershell and convince yourself: <strong>Jekyll is up and running!</strong></p>
