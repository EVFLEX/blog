Test 1: plain Knit md_document
* put 2015-07-27-a-post-to-test-knitr-to-jekyll.Rmd in _source with output: md_document and remove all other content generated in earlier experiments with this file.
* Knit md into _source (push button)
* Run jekyll serve in directory evflex (branche gh-pages) in powershell
  * Nothing happens: stop jekyll serve
* copy md_document and subfolder (figures) to _post.
* Run jekyll serve again
  * Jekyll stops because it cannot handle cars-1.png (invalid byte sequence)
  
Test 2: generate md with servr::jekyll()
* put 2015-07-27-a-post-to-test-knitr-to-jekyll.Rmd in _source with output: md_document and remove all other content generated in earlier experiments with this file.
* run servr::jekyll() in the R Studio console
  * a blank viewer is opened (showing html while there is only .md I presume)
  * an .md file with the same name is created in _posts
  * a directory with the same name is created in evflex/figure/source that contains a .png of the plots in the file.
  * a directory with the same name is created in _site containing an index.html.
    * we stop servr::jekyll() in the R console and start jekyll serve in powershell
      * If we surf to 127.0.0.1:4000/filename the result is there but looks awful: yaml matter is missing and LaTex was ignored or the text is $shown as is$

Test 3: generate html with servr::jekyll()
* put 2015-07-27-a-post-to-test-knitr-to-jekyll.Rmd in _source with output: html_document and remove all other content generated in earlier experiments with this file.
* run servr::jekyll() in the R Studio console
  * a blank viewer is opened (showing html while there is only .md I presume)
  * an .md file with the same name is created in _posts
  * a directory with the same name is created in evflex/figure/source that contains png's of the plots in the file.
  * a directory with the same name is created in _site containing an index.html.
    * we stop servr::jekyll() in the R console and start jekyll serve in powershell
      * If we surf to 127.0.0.1:4000/filename the result is there but looks awful: yaml matter is missing and LaTex was ignored or the text is $shown as is$

Test 4: generate html with servr::jekyll() in Yihui's repo
* as three but now from Yihui's repro **and after adding the laout: post** tag to YaML. 
  * Much better! Liquid tags are also generated. However, no good Latex. Everything between $$this$$ is simply ignored and the other stuff treated as text.
  
Test 5: as 4 but now in evflex again
  * When we stop jekyll in the console and start it in powershell we see the post is there and has been given some layout but does not look as nice. E.g. source blocks are divided into separate lines.

# Original testcontent
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Some of my testcontent

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
  * Lower level list
  * Lower level list
* And back

# LateX textcontent (3 formula's)

$( x^2 + y^2 = 1 )$

$$( x^2 + y^2 = 1 )$$

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$$

# Some more R code

Now we write some R code chunks in this post. For example,

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('servr', 'knitr'), repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com')
```

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
cat("hello world!")
set.seed(123)
(x = rnorm(40) + 10)
# generate a table
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
(function() {
  if (TRUE) 1 + 1  # a boring comment
})()
names(formals(servr::jekyll))  # arguments of the jekyll() function
```

Just to test inline R expressions[^2] in **knitr**, we know the first element in `x` (created in the code chunk above) is `r x[1]`. You can certainly draw some graphs as well:

[^2]: The syntax in R Markdown for inline expressions is `` `r code` ``, where `code` is the R expression that you want to evaluate, e.g. `x[1]`.

```{r cars, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.cap='A scatterplot of the cars data'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'red')  # a scatterplot
```
