### Yihui's knitr template












## Play around with Jekyll themes

## Turn the .Rmd files into .md files

## Add .md files to your Jekyll site

## Automate the process from .Rmd to published .md on Jekyll






# Guys and gals who have been there

<https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll> who build knitr gives us an example of a Jekyll based website using knitr and R Markdown. The idea is to serve the files locally and push them to the gh-pages branch of your Github repo when you are satisfied







[John Zelner is auto-generating blog posts in R Markdown with jekyll and knitr](http://www.jonzelner.net/jekyll/knitr/r/2014/07/02/autogen-knitr/) on 02 July 2014. Mixing Markdown (and TeX) with R using Knitr is a joy, and even more so when you can auto-generate your results and view them live as you save changes.

John has set it up in the following way:

  * He saves his .Rmd file to a _knitr directory in the root of his Jekyll site.
  * There is an auto executing render_post.R script that watches for incoming files and re-knits the .Rmd file into vanilla markdown and copies it to the _posts directory. 
  *

[Automated Knitr In Jekyll](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/07/automated-knitr-in-jekyll.html) by Carl Bouttiger in jan 2015. Yihui Xie, author & maintainer of knitr, has a nice little package out called servr for serving websites from R. It includes a handy jekyll function which streamlines the process of first running knitr on any .Rmd posts before running Jekyll.

[Blog with RStudio, R, RMarkdown, Jekyll and Github](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/)
I wanted to be able to write about R related things without having to copy and paste code, figures or files. I had used Rmarkdown and knitr before so wanted to use them. I have a wordpress site elsewhere that someone helped me set up a couple of years ago with a blog that I’ve never used. Initially I tried seeing if I could create posts using RMarkdown and put them into that wordpress blog. A brief search revealed that was not straightforward and that Jekyll was the way to go.

[Blogging with RStudio and Nikola](http://www.znmeb.mobi/stories/blogging-with-rstudio-and-nikola.html) My goal was to replace my Github Pages Octopress blog with a mobile-first responsive static website / blog authored in R Markdown. The options were

  * Stay with Github Pages / Jekyll / Octopress but author with RStudio,
  * Switch to another static site generator and author with RStudio,
  * Abandon site generators altogether and just author with R Markdown website build tools or knitrBootstrap, and
  * Create a site from the ground up with Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation.

Staying with Github Pages wasn’t a realistic option:

  * The gh-pages branch hack only works for Github,
  * Octopress theming is poorly documented – as far as I can tell the Octopress documentation hasn’t been touched in over three years,
  * Site compilation and deployment are extremely sensitive to Ruby language versioning and use obscure Git-isms, and
  * Octopress isn’t mobile first – it’s just marginally responsive.

[Creating Jekyll blog posts from R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/creating-jekyll-blog-posts-from-r/)
This post is not about getting set up using Jekyll or Jekyll Bootstrap. It’s about establishing a good workflow from R Markdown -> Jekyll Blogpost -> R-Bloggers

[Alfred, RStudio, and Jekyll Workflow](http://blog.eremrah.com/articles/Alfred_RStudio_and_Jekyll/)
There are some sources online showing how this can be done, like this, this, or this but I wanted some easy solutions to automate the workflow. First we need to convert the .Rmd file we write in RStudio to a vanilla .md file in order Jekyll to handle it. Derek Feng has a great make.R file on this Github page. 

[Blog with Knitr and Jekyll](https://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/)
The knitr package provides an easy way to embed R code in a Jekyll-Bootstrap blog post. The only required input is an R Markdown source file. The name of the source file used to generate this post is 2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd, available here. Steps taken to build this post are as follows...

[Using (R) Markdown, Jekyll, & GitHub for a Website](http://jason.bryer.org/posts/2012-12-10/Markdown_Jekyll_R_for_Blogging.html)
a shell script and R function to convert rmd files to a plain Markdown file that Jekyll can then process. This approach is necessary when using GitHub Pages because user plugins are not supported.
